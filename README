SRT files for use with mplayer:
give the srt file the same name as the movie file, and place it alongside the movie in the same directory

TODO:
write a filthyfilter script that greps the .srt for swears, outputs the time offsets for that line of text (calculated from the beginning time of the next line of text, or 3 seconds, whichever is shorter?) as an EDL file entry.

Then sed the swear with asterisks (bouns points: random punctuations) and re-write it to the orig .srt
